- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mpldr
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Free Software
	- which is part of the reason most of my projects live on [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~poldi1405) and are only mirrored here
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning <!-- I'm always learning something and I can't be bothered updating that bi-weekly -->
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: see [moritz.sh](https://moritz.sh)
- I'm too lazy to write more
